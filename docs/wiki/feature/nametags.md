## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Nametag and rank display
Adds nametags and soldier ranks to friendly players in multiplayer. This can be adjusted in the ACE Options Menu to not display the rank, display all nametags of nearby soldiers instead of those who are looked directly at, to require a button press to show the nametags or to disable them altogether.

### 1.2 Arma 3 VON, ACRE and TFAR soundwaves
A soundwave effect is shown when someone is speaking using either the vanilla VON, ACRE 1 or 2 and TFAR.
