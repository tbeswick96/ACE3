## 1. Overview

Add a range card that updates itself for your weapon and the type of ammo you're using.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Opening the range card
- Open the self interaction menu <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>âŠž&nbsp;Win</kbd>
- Select `Equipment`
- Select `Open Range Card`

### 2.2 Using the range card
- To use this to it's full potential the use of a `Vector 21` is strongly recommended, a `Kestrel 4500` will also help.

- Pull out your rangefinder (`Vector 21` preferred) and get the distance between you and your target.

- Open your rangetable and look under the `Target range` column.

- Move to the `Bullet Drop` column, the drop is in MRADs, you need to compensate for it by adjusting your sight. Example, you want to adjust for a bullet drop of -7.9 MRADs  simply adjust your scope 7.9 MRADs vertically. (check [feature scopes](http://ace3mod.com/wiki/feature/scopes.html) ) for this.
