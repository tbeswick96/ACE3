## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Magazine Names
Unifies the name formatting of magazines similar to Arma 2 standards.

### 1.2 No tracers in non-tracer mags
Assault rifles no longer have tracer rounds in their non-tracer magazines. This doesn't effect the additional tracers in the last rounds of machine gun magazines.

### 1.3 Real magazine round counts
All pistol and sub machine gun magazines now have adjusted capacities to match their real life counterparts.
