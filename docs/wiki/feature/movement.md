## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Jumping
Adds the ability to jump when pressing the vault key while moving. (<kbd>V</kbd>)

### 1.2 Minor animation tweaks
Walking slowly with the weapon lowered now has a less silly looking animation.

Soldiers get fatigued slower, but regain their stamina slower aswell. Fatigued soldiers have a faster walking speed and no longer turn into snails.
