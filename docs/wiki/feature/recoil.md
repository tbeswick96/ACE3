## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Recoil adjustment
Overhauls the recoil system reducing upwards recoil.

### 1.2 Advanced cam shake
Introducing camshake when firing on foot or as vehicle gunner depending on stance and weapon type.

### 1.3 Burst dispersion
Firing in longer burst (> 3 rounds per burst) slightly reduces the accuracy. Firing machine guns in bursts is now useful.
