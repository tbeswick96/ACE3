## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Switch units

"ACE SwitchUnits" is a tool for mission makers to quickly add PvP (Player vs. Player) elements to a mission. In short it enables a player to control AI units. Allowing players to perform as enemies even during a COOP mission increases the authenticity of the enemy and thus the immersion for everyone.

The most prominent feature of ACE SwitchUnits is that you can add it to nearly every existing mission and get AI control out of the box. Dynamic mission like "Enemy Assault", "Patrol Ops", "Invade & Annex", etc. don't need to be touched to make all random spawned AI's controllable.

In its current form you're able to switch to infantry (vehicles, etc. are planned) from all four sides (West, East, Independent, Civilian).

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Switching to a unit
- Open your map
- Find a unit you can access (they are showed with special icons and names on the map).
- Press <kbd>LMB</kbd> on the desired unit.
- You'll control that unit until it dies or until you switch to an other one. If the unit dies you'll be brought back to your original unit..
