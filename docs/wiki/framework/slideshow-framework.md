## 1. Overview

Slideshow is a very powerful tool for mission makers and platoon leaders giving them the power to project images on some objects.

Slideshow is setup through a module or [function](#create-slideshow).

Important notes:

- Only objects with `hiddenSelection` `0` can be used as "screens".
- If you set a duration the remotes will be disabled (if the remotes are disabled `ace_interaction` is not needed).
- You can have multiple sets of images on different screens by using multiple modules/function calls.
- It is advisable images resolution sizes are powers of 2 (eg. 512x512) to avoid graphical glitches in them.

<h5>Note:</h5>
<p>Mission MUST be in a PBO format (not bare folder) when used on a dedicated server with slideshow images inside a mission due to an <a href="https://feedback.bistudio.com/T80668">issue</a> to prevent errors.</p>
