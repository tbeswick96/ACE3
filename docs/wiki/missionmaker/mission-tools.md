## 1. ACE Rallypoints
*Part of: ace_respawn*

"ACE Rallypoints" is a two way teleport system between two positions. Usually this is used to transport units that have died during a mission back to the front line. The rally points are portrayed by flagpoles (West, East and Independant flagpoles are available) that have a "Base" and an "Exit" version.

They can be found in the editor under: "Empty" >> "ACE Respawn"

**Classnames:**

- `ACE_Rallypoint_West`, `ACE_Rallypoint_West_Base`
- `ACE_Rallypoint_East`, `ACE_Rallypoint_East_Base`
- `ACE_Rallypoint_Independent`, `ACE_Rallypoint_Independent_Base`

Using the Interaction Menu on a rallypoint offers the ability to teleport from one flagpole to the other flagpole and vice versa.

If you want to change the texture of the flag use this line:

```js
this setFlagTexture 'path\to\my\texture\my_awesome_clan_logo.paa';
```

*Note: You can't place more than one rallypoint of the same type.*

All units synced to the ["Rallypoint System" module](./modules.html#1.14-rallypoint-system) are able to move the rallypoint.

<div class="panel callout">
    <h5>Note:</h5>
    <p>It's important to mention that this doesn't work for player who join during a mission (JIP = Join in progress). That's something we can't change because that's the way Bohemia Interactive has implemented their module framework.</p>
</div>

To enable other units to move them add this to the unit's initialization code:

```js
_unit setVariable ["ACE_canMoveRallypoint", true, true];
```

## 2. ACE SwitchUnits
*Part of: ace_switchunits*

"ACE SwitchUnits" is a tool for misson makers to quickly add PvP (Player vs. Player) elements to a mission. In short it enables a player to control AI units. Allowing players to perform as enemies even during a COOP mission increases the authenticity of the enemy and thus the immersion for everyone.

The most prominent feature of ACE SwitchUnits is that you can add it to nearly every existing mission and get AI control out of the box. Dynamic mission like "Enemy Assault", "Patrol Ops", "Invade & Annex", etc. don't need to be touched to make all random spawned AI's controllable.

In its current form you're able to switch to infantry (vehicles, etc. are planned) from all four sides (West, East, Independent, Civilian).

To enable a player to control AI add the following to its init line:

```js
this setVariable ["ACE_CanSwitchUnits", true];
```
Once this player spawns, all controllable AI will be marked on his map and he'll be able to click on the map to switch to this unit. The initial unit will be prone to damage, but has no equipment and can't run. So it would be wise to hide or move this unit far from other players.

The [module settings](./modules.html#1.16-switchunits-system) define which side a player can control or how big the radius of the safe zone is. The safe zone is a circular zone around AI units that must be clear from players of an opposing side to be able to switch to.

## 3. ACE Slideshow
*Part of: ace_slideshow*

"ACE Slideshow" is a very powerful tool for mission makers and platoon leaders giving them the power to project images on some objects.
You will now learn how to set up everything for it to work properly.

### 3.1 The module explained

Name | Explanation
---- | -----
Objects | Name of the objects used as screens
Controllers | Name of the objects used as controllers
Images | Full path of the image from the mission folder/file or from an other mod (even BI PBOs work)
Interaction names | Name of your interactions
Slide duration | 0 (0 = disabled, number is in seconds)

- Only objects with hiddenSelection 0 can be used as "screens".
- If you set a duration the remotes will be disabled. (If the remotes are disabled `ace_interaction` is not needed)
- You can have multiple sets of images on different screens, see the advanced slideshow below.
- It is advisable images resolution sizes are powers of 2 (eg. 512x512) to avoid graphical glitches in them.

<div class="panel callout">
    <h5>Note:</h5>
    <p>Mission MUST be in a PBO format (not bare folder) when used on a dedicated server due to an <a href="http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=22310">issue</a> to prevent errors.</p>
</div>

### 3.2 Basic slideshow
*A set of 4 images that are swapped via a remote*

Note that all names and interaction names are examples.

- First place the slideshow module down.
- Place the object that will be used as a "screen" and give it the name `foo1`
- Place the object you want to use as a remote and name it `bar1`
- In your mission folder create a new folder called images and drop your banana images there.
- Place down the module and fill it as follows:

Name | Written
---- | -----
Objects | foo1
Controllers | bar1
Images | images\banana1.jpg,images\banana2.jpg,images\banana3.jpg,images\banana4.jpg
Interaction names | banana1,banana2,banana3,banana4
Slide duration | 0

- Go in game and enjoy your bananas

### 3.3 Multiple screens and remotes
*2 set of "screens" and remotes*

- First place the slideshow module down.
- Place 2 objects that you want to use as "screens" and call them `foo1` and `foo2`
- Place 2 objects you want to use as remotes and call them `bar1` and `bar2`
- In your mission folder create a new folder called images and drop your banana images there.
- Place down 2 modules and fill them as follows:

*Module 1*
  
Name | Written
---- | -----
Objects | foo1
Controllers | bar1
Images | images\banana1.jpg,images\banana2.jpg
Interaction names | banana1,banana2
Slide duration | 0

*Module 2*

Name | Written
---- | -----
objects | foo2
Controllers | bar2
images | images\banana3.jpg,images\banana4.jpg
Interaction names | banana3,banana4
Slide duration | 0
  
- You now have two set of "screens" with a remote each.
